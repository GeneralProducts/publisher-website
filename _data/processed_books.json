cross-disciplinary methods which help us to approach and interpret material culture and materials.    ","reviews":"This is the first comprehensive presentation and review of methods for the study of material things that incorporates the advances in material culture studies and a variety of anthropological and sociological developments of recent decades. It has extraordinary breadth including both the planning of research and the presentation of results, alongside considerations of analysis and theory, taken from a broad spectrum between art and science and all delivered in a clear and thoughtful style. There are many original ideas and suggestions for how to proceed. The result will be invaluable for students and researchers wanting to study our ever expanding world of material and visual culture. -- Daniel Miller   What an excellent book Sophie Woodward has written! In 'Material Methods' she brings into the methodological mainstream a sophisticated and provocative analysis of the possibilities of researching the material world, in a most timely way. She considers what it means for researchers to attune themselves to and engage with the vitality of 'things', in ways that will provoke and inspire them to think and research differently. In chapters that cover the whole research process and span a wide range of material methods, she deftly weaves a discussion that will help the reader to be theoretically astute, practically informed, and inspired to try out new approaches.  Whether or not you plan to use material methods, this book has the potential to change not only the way you do your research, but also your theoretical take on the world. -- Jennifer Mason      An insightful synthesis of key currents in studies of materiality and an essential guide for actually doing materiality studies. This book will be invaluable in helping researchers and students understand the different ways they can work with objects in their research practice.    -- Ian Woodward","subject":"Research methods: general, Research methods: general, Anthropology, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Research, Library & Information Science, General, Research methods: general, Anthropology","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191029","page_count":null,"usd_price":"40.00","gbp_price":"27.99","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Doing Research in the Business World: Paperback with Interactive eBook","isbn":"9781529704198","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1529704197","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1529704197","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1529704197","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1529704197","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1529704197","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1529704197","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1529704197","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1529704197","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1529704197","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1529704197","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781529704198","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781529704198","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781529704198","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781529704198&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781529704198&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781529704198","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781529704198","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781529704198&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781529704198&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781529704198","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781529704198","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781529704198","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781529704198","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781529704198","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781529704198","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781529704198;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781529704198.jpg","author":"David E Gray","blurb":"   Practical and clear, this book guides business and management students through the entire research process.

over thirty years of experience in working with and teaching people to work with data, this book is <em>  the </em>  globally-reaching guide for any postgraduate student or researcher looking to build their data management skills. \n       ","reviews":"This book is a 'must have' for anyone teaching or learning about this topic. The reader is taken on a journey of discovery and at the end will be well equipped to manage and share research data in all aspects. -- Jane Fry      This book remains an essential guide for researchers and data professionals concerned with best practice data management. Accessible. Practical. Comprehensive. This edition has been revised and updated to address legal changes as well as challenges posed by new forms of data. This is a trusty companion for novices and experts alike. Highly recommended.    -- Chris Gibson   Written by experts in the field, this book offers a comprehensive introduction to key topics in research data management across the whole research lifecycle. Already established as an indispensable handbook, this new edition provides up to date case studies, practical guidance and extensive references. Highly recommended. -- Wayne Peters   Data are a major asset of economic and social research, and the quality and provenance of research datasets fundamentally underpins the extent to which they can subsequently be shared and reused. The ESRC is the UK's largest funder of research on social and economic issues and has long been at the forefront of promoting the importance of data sharing.  \n \nAs the volume and complexity of datasets available to researchers continues to increase, the importance of data management in the advancement of economic and social science research becomes ever more apparent. This book approaches these topics accessibly and will offer insights to a wide audience, from those at starting to think about data management to those seeking to refresh their skills. -- Alison Park   For CESSDA, as consortium of trusted repositories that offers a research infrastructure with tools and services for data producers and data re-users, good data practices throughout the data lifecycle are deemed essential to facilitate high-quality research that benefits society.  \n \nThis book - full of practical guidance and tips, case studies and examples, and written by longstanding and experienced CESSDA members - helps to develop the skills of researchers and data professionals to produce high quality data that are well described, curated, re-usable and as openly accessible as possible. By describing the sometimes complex facets of data management in an easy and clear way, especially with regards the ethical and legal aspects of sharing and reusing social science data, this book helps to set researchers on a path to more open science. -- Ron Dekker","subject":"Social research & statistics, Social research & statistics, Economics, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Research, Social Sciences:

This book will definitely sharpen your sense of what social media can do for academics and academic work.  \nCarrigan does a great job of demystifying social media for newcomers to the fray, while also prompting veterans to reassess how (and why) they post, tweet and share their scholarship.  \nA great reminder to switch off your device and reflect critically on the nature of scholarship in the digital age.   -- Neil Selwyn      Three years on from Carrigan's first edition of Social Media for Academics he has once again captured everything you need to know right now about this phenomenon through a higher education lens. He gives solid practical advice backed up by evidence, like how to employ social media in an impact driven environment whilst avoiding its pitfalls.      \n    -- Andy Tattersall      A thoughtful and thought-provoking exploration of what it means to be a scholar in the digital age. All academics interested in how social media produce knowledge and complicate traditional models of knowledge production should read this book.

Carrigan's easy-to-read and comprehensive guide explores social media from a range of perspectives, filling a much needed gap within academic development literature.

the Core of Transformational Leadership","image_path":"9789353287047.jpg","author":"Nancy Stanford Blair and Mark L. Gesner","blurb":"A book that inspires you to discover your own path towards transformational leadership.","reviews":"   This book skillfully pulls together important lessons from diverse exemplars who remind us that to lead effectively, we must be willing to listen, learn, value people and be open to challenging our mindsets so that ultimately we can transform local and global systems for a more sustainable future. To be a true leader, one must stay curious and always be learning.    -- Dr Mehmood Khan, * Life Biosciences CEO and PepsiCo Former Vice Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer *      Managers manage, leaders lead and inspirational leaders inspire. It's a journey all leaders take, some reach the final stage, but why some and not others? Becoming that leader who inspires means that people follow because they believe in something bigger than themselves, the company that they work for and the product or service that they provide. Fulfillment comes in many forms, but finding it in work can be one of life's greatest pleasures and this book will help many find such fulfillment.    -- Jeff Hembrock, * Former President, Miller Brewing Company *      Here is an inspirational examination of a wide range of highly effective leaders-of how their individual growth was shaped by determination, focus, courage and life experience. This instructive, thought-provoking analysis has universal and multigenerational appeal to readers at various stages of their career path. It encourages you to be authentic, embrace your uniqueness with pride and dare to reach beyond your comfort zone.    -- Brenda B. Schoonover, * US Ambassador (Retired) *      In today's hypercompetitive business environment, regardless of industry, culture or geography, defining effective leadership through a lens of bottom line outcomes is misguided and limiting relative to achieving real impact. Blair and Gesner capture what is critically missing by demonstrating the importance of mission-driven leadership, providing a new value proposition in our thinking of what it means to lead inspirationally and intentionally by institutionalizing one's life mission in our work.  \n    -- Matthew Wagner, PhD, * Vice President of Revitalization Programs, Main Street America, Former SC Johnson Global Community Affairs Director and India Fulbright Specialist *   Humility. Respect. Reflection. These are among the principles critically important for meaningful public service; but how do they inform a person's capacity to be a transformational leader? What this book accomplishes in compelling fashion is to demonstrate that if our leadership isn't grounded in core values that embrace dignity for ourselves and others, then we not only diminish our influence, we diminish humanity as a whole. Lift up yourself, lift up others, read this book. \n    -- Thomas Schnaubelt, PhD, * Executive Director and Associate Vice Provost, Haas Center for Public Service, Stanford University *      In an eloquent, yet conversational style, this volume inspires the ordinary to cross over into the extraordinary space of 'power-with' leadership. Interspersing hypothetical conversations of the world's greatest leaders of all time with the narratives of living leaders who inspire, the authors provoke the readers into making impactful meaning from their own lives. The volume spurs us to live to touch lives, to walk the talk and to leave a footprint.    -- Nalini Bikkina, PhD, * Director-in-Charge, Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) School of Gandhian Studies, and Former Fulbright Academic Excellence Fellow, the University of Nebraska, Omaha *   Achieving the changes our world needs will take leadership. But many of us who care about the common good do not see ourselves as leaders. Blair and Gesner invite us to step back, look at our lives and values, and write ourselves a new story in which we rise to the challenges that matter to us. We have never needed this invitation- and their guidance-more than right now.  -- Andrew J. Seligsohn, PhD, * President, Campus Compact (USA) *      Young entrepreneurs like the ones we support want their work to contribute to society, but they also want to make enough money to create wealth for themselves and their communities. There's a new generation of leaders like us working to mobilize people, information, resources and capital for the greater good. Applying the lessons in this book can help us achieve the positive influence and impact that we seek.    -- Que El-Amin, * Co-Founder and CEO, Young Enterprising Society *      A thoughtfully crafted resource for personal and professional growth. The authors nailed it in that being a successful leader begins with leading self, first. This book offers relevant examples and stories from real-world leaders and would be a strong supplement to university leadership courses at all levels. Readers will be invited to reflect on their values and behaviors as a means to be in alignment with their authentic self. The book is a reminder that to be successful, we must stay open to learning and unlearning!    -- Lisa Gies, Ed.D, * Dean, College of Education and Leadership, Cardinal Stritch University *      Leadership may take different forms around the world, but at its core, transformational leadership is fundamentally the same and can be implemented effectively across geographic regions, disciplines and cultures. Become inspired, as I was, by the insights offered by this diverse mix of industry leaders; examine their common threads and uncover the positive influence that will encourage healthy growth for yourself and the organizations you serve.    -- Abdulrhman F. Almotery, ME-PD, PhD, * Director of Academic and Training Affairs, Royal Commission Health Services Program, Saudi Arabia *      Go on this inspirational journey to find your best self and the legacy you want to leave behind. Every leader struggles with challenges, and Blair and Gesner provide practical, reflective strategies that call upon us to look inside ourselves to deepen our leadership. This is a life-changing must-read for anyone looking to find their sense of purpose and particularly valuable for those aspiring to create educational systems that will inspire a new generation of missiondriven teachers and students.    -- Dr Courtney Orzel, * Superintendent of Schools, Lemont SD113A, Lemont, Illinois *   Delivered at just the right time, this book inspires leaders to move intentionally towards the clarity of mission-driven lives. Nancy Stanford Blair has generously shared her expertise guiding several generations of leaders in occupational therapy as a part of the AOTA Leadership Development Programs. Together, Blair and Gesner extend the wisdom of 100+ leaders across business, education, health care, non-profits and military who are successfully engaged in building sustainable leadership. Give yourself the gift of time to read this book and enrich your own leadership development.  -- Ginny Stoffel, PhD, * American Occupational Therapy Association (Ex-President) *","subject":"Business & management, Organizational theory & behaviour, BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / General, Management & Business: General, Business and Management, Business & Management, Organizational theory & behaviour","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191114","page_count":null,"usd_price":"20.00","gbp_price":"16.00","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"The Sociology of Work","isbn":"9781526402646","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526402645","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526402645","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526402645","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526402645","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526402645","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526402645","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526402645","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526402645","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526402645","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526402645","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526402646","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526402646","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526402646","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526402646&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526402646&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526402646","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526402646","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526402646&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526402646&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526402646","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526402646","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526402646","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526402646","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526402646","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526402646","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526402646;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Continuity and Change in Paid and Unpaid Work","image_path":"9781526402646.jpg","author":"Stephen Edgell and Edward Granter","blurb":"Now in a fully updated third edition, <em>  The Sociology of Work</em>   draws on the work of classic and contemporary theorists, to provide readers with a thorough exploration of all aspects of work and employment, including paid and unpaid work, standard and non-standard employment, and even unemployment.","reviews":"   'Definitive, critical and engaging, this is a superb introduction to the sociology of work. Edgell and Granter's expert narrative takes us from the cotton mills to the gig economy, and from unpaid domestic chores to visions of a post-work future. Indispensable.' \nLeo McCann is Professor of Management, University of York.  \n \n    -- Leo McCann      A welcome new edition of Sociology of Work delivers on the promise to chronicle and to assess continuity and changes in paid and unpaid work over the longue duree.  Key themes and theories drive chapters on alienation, the labor process, skill, organizational culture, Fordism, destandarization, and domestic work, culminating in the perfect bookend on work transformations across multiple historical globalizations spanning the global North and South.    \n     \n   Heidi Gottfried, Professor of Sociology, Wayne State University, Michigan \n    -- Heidi Gottfried      Stephen Edgell and Edward Granter's The Sociology of Work is an introductory text that is more engaging and coherent than a traditional textbook. It provides an accessible entry point into the field, covering a vast literature and counterposing competing theories and perspectives, but within a systematic analytical framework and narrative. It appreciates the variable social construction of work and employment across history, understands capitalism as a distinct social system, and compellingly uses the framework of Fordism and Post-Fordism to highlight and understand changes in work and employment over the 20th and 21st centuries. \n     \n   Dr Matt Vidal, Reader in Sociology and Comparative Political Economy, Loughborough University  \n    -- Dr Matt Vidal","subject":"Sociology & anthropology, Sociology, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Sociology / General, Social Sciences: Textbooks & Study Guides, Society, Sociology & anthropology, Sociology","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191207","page_count":null,"usd_price":"44.00","gbp_price":"33.99","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Children's Mental Health and Emotional Well-being in Primary Schools","isbn":"9781526468215","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526468212","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526468212","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526468212","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526468212","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526468212","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526468212","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526468212","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526468212","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526468212","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526468212","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526468215","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526468215","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526468215","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526468215&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526468215&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526468215","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526468215","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526468215&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526468215&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526468215","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526468215","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526468215","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526468215","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526468215","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526468215","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526468215;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781526468215.jpg","author":"Colin Howard, Maddie Burton, and Denisse Levermore","blurb":"This is essential reading for aspiring and practicing primary school teachers to develop strategies to enhance the importance of mental health and emotional well-being.

It provides the reader with various approaches, illustrates their applications and is of great value to any student, researcher or practitioner interested in participatory research methods.    -- Ingvill C.

Biopolitics of Mobility at Europe's Borders","image_path":"9781526464040.jpg","author":"Martina Tazzioli","blurb":"   <em>  The Making of Migration</em>   addresses the rapid phenomenon that has become one of the most contentious issues in contemporary life: how are migrants governed as individual subjects and as part of groups?    ","reviews":"   The Making of Migration is a timely and extremely original book. Analyzing at the same time technologies of control and migrants' practices of resistance it casts migration as a battleground. And it compels us to test and rethink our political vocabulary within that battleground. \n   Sandro Mezzadra, Associate Professor of Political Theory, the University of Bologna. \n    -- Sandro Mezzadra      In <em>  The Making of Migration</em>  , Martina Tazzioli invites us to truly examine how \"migration and \"migrants\" are in fact <em>  made</em>  .  Refusing to permit the lazy complacencies of treating these as self-evident sociological categories, Tazzioli aims a sharp critical lens on the governmentalities at stake in subjecting human mobility to various forms of control and government as well as knowledge production, while simultaneously never ceasing to see the struggles of people on the move across borders as central and constitutive of the making of their own \"migrant\" subjectivities.  Mobility then emerges as a stake for both migrants and the border regimes invested in governing them as such.  In all of this, Tazzioli also keeps us focused on the ways that these processes of subject-making are at once individualizing and also generate various kinds of collectivities.  This book is a rich and original contribution to migration and border studies, and also a major intervention into political philosophy. \n     \n   Nicholas De Genova, Professor and Chair of the Department of Comparative Cultural Studies, University of Houston.   \n    -- Nicholas De Genova      <em>  The Making of Migration </em>  radically shifts the analytical categories through which we understand how migration is governed. By proposing a new analytical lexicon of migrant multiplicities and singularities as different from both individuals and populations, Martina Tazzioli changes the direction of research on migration by inserting the political dimensions of subjectification-subjection and objectivation-subjectivation. Through the lens of migration, the book challenges the central categories of political thought and develops a much-needed bridge between migration studies and critical questions of power, politics and spatiality. \n     \n     \n   Claudia Aradau, Professor of International Politics, King's College London \n    -- Claudia Aradau","subject":"Human geography, Migration, immigration & emigration, Political science & theory, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Human Geography, Geography, Geography, Human geography, Political science & theory, Migration, immigration & emigration","series":"Society and Space","series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191207","page_count":null,"usd_price":"36.00","gbp_price":"24.99","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"The SAGE Handbook of Inclusion and Diversity in Education","isbn":"9781526435552","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526435551","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526435551","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526435551","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526435551","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526435551","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526435551","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526435551","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526435551","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526435551","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526435551","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526435552","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526435552","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526435552","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526435552&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526435552&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526435552","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526435552","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526435552&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526435552&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526435552","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526435552","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526435552","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526435552","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526435552","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526435552","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526435552;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781526435552.jpg","author":"Matthew J.

This volume is a must-read for all educators hoping to deepen their understanding of the complexities and contradictions of inclusive education. \n    -- Mara Sapon-Shevin      This important new volume is published at a crucial time with regards to the idea of inclusion in education. It appears during a period when the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is calling for international efforts to promote inclusive and equitable quality education, and lifelong learning opportunities for all. This has brought the issue to the forefront of policy developments in many countries. Directly relevant to this global agenda for change, the chapters set out to take stock of scholarship on diversity and inclusion in education in the first two decades of the 21st century, and to look forward to future trends and new directions. In so doing, it draws on a remarkable range of sources from around the world. It also includes chapters that are written from an impressive range of perspectives. I suspect that this handbook will be a major source of stimulation to many of us who are concerned with this crucial agenda. \n    -- Mel Ainscow CBE","subject":"Teaching of students with English as a second language (TESOL), Education, EDUCATION / Inclusive Education, EDUCATION / Educational Policy & Reform / General, Electronic books, Education & Teaching, Education, Teaching of a specific subject, Education","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191017","page_count":null,"usd_price":"185.00","gbp_price":"120.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Psychology and Crime","isbn":"9781446287422","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1446287424","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1446287424","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1446287424","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1446287424","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1446287424","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1446287424","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1446287424","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1446287424","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1446287424","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1446287424","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781446287422","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781446287422","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781446287422","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781446287422&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781446287422&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781446287422","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781446287422","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781446287422&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781446287422&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781446287422","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781446287422","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781446287422","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781446287422","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781446287422","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781446287422","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781446287422;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"A Transdisciplinary Perspective","image_path":"9781446287422.jpg","author":"Craig Webber","blurb":"Now in an updated second edition, this book continues to explore the links between psychology and crime, taking the reader through psychological explanations of crime and the use of psychology within the criminal justice system.","reviews":"   This second edition retains all the strengths of the first while adding fresh insight to contemporary issues. Craig Webber's knowledge of the field and his openness to a wide range of approaches has resulted in an indispensable guide to criminological psychology. Psychology &amp; Crime provides a lively, thought provoking and authoritative introduction to a rapidly growing area and succeeds in stretching thinking beyond current orthodoxies. \n    -- Eamonn Carrabine      Craig Webber has achieved a rare feat; a book that connects psychology and crime in a way that honours the rich history of sociological approaches to crime with current insights from psychology. It reads well, is well structured and combines the fields of criminology and psychology in a most engaging fashion. The many students who take a combination of psychology with criminology will thank him for this book. \n     \n    -- Francis Pakes   Praise for the previous edition: \n \nCriminologists have been waiting a very long time for a psychology of crime that speaks their language. Finally it has arrived. Craig Webber brings together a wealth of psychological research that students of criminology ignore at their peril. He also documents the significant in-roads criminologists are now making with regard to matters of the mind too often treated as 'off-limits' by many social scientists, psychologists included. \n<strong>  Dr David Gadd \nKeele University</strong>\n     \n\n     \n   Webber has pulled off a unique feat by writing a book on the psychology of crime that will appeal equally to sociologists and criminologists. The book provides up-to-date and scholarly coverage of the investigative psychology literature on policing serial offending and mass murderers, but also integrates sophisticated discussions of Stan Cohen's theory of denial, the Birmingham School of cultural studies, and Green Criminology. This exciting theoretical integration bodes very well for the future of criminal psychology. \n<strong>  Professor Shadd Maruna \nQueen's University Belfast</strong>   \n     \n\n     \n   Craig Webber's <em>  Psychology and Crime</em>   does a good job of opening up psychology to criminologists...Webber's book is 'criminological' in its starting position and psychology is not approached as the stand-alone discipline it is often thought to be. That sets it apart from other texts. For that reason criminologists may well find this one particularly accessible... The book as a whole does a good job in cautiously welcoming psychology into the criminological mainstream. For those initially apprehensive of psychology, this is a good choice of text that should find its way onto readings lists in particular for psychology-related modules within criminology courses. That is a readership for whom this text should be particularly valuable. \n<strong>  Dr Francis Pakes \nInternet Journal of Criminology</strong>      -- Reviews","subject":"Crime & criminology, Crime & criminology, Crime & criminology, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Criminology, Social Sciences: Textbooks & Study Guides, Crime, Crime & criminology","series":"Key Approaches to Criminology","series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191021","page_count":null,"usd_price":"111.00","gbp_price":"85.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Learning Theories for Everyday Teaching","isbn":"9781526469816","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526469812","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526469812","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526469812","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526469812","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526469812","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526469812","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526469812","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526469812","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526469812","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526469812","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526469816","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526469816","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526469816","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526469816&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526469816&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526469816","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526469816","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526469816&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526469816&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526469816","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526469816","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526469816","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526469816","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526469816","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526469816","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526469816;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781526469816.jpg","author":"Carol Thompson and Lydia Spenceley","blurb":"This is more than just a book about learning theories, it shows new and trainee teachers how to use theory to improve their teaching and to help students learn more every day.

Migration shakes up political scenes and instigates new social movements. It redraws emotional landscapes and reshapes social networks, with traditional and digital media enabling, representing, and shaping the processes, relationships and people on the move. The deep entanglement of media and migration expands across the fields of political, cultural and social life. For example, migration is increasingly digitally tracked and surveilled, and national and international policy-making draws on data on migrant movement, anticipated movement, and biometrics to maintain a sense of control over the mobilities of humans and things. Also, social imaginaries are constituted in highly mediated environments where information and emotions on migration are constantly shared on social and traditional media. Both, those migrating and those receiving them, turn to media and communicative practices to learn how to make sense of migration and to manage fears and desires associated with cross-border mobility in an increasingly porous but also controlled and divided world. \n   <strong>  The SAGE Handbook of Media and Migration</strong>   offers a comprehensive overview of media and migration through new research, as well as a review of present scholarship in this expanding and promising field. It explores key interdisciplinary concepts and methodologies, and how these are challenged by new realities and the links between contemporary migration patterns and its use of mediated processes. Although primarily grounded in media and communication studies, the Handbook builds on research in the fields of sociology, anthropology, political science, urban studies, science and technology studies, human rights, development studies, and gender and sexuality studies, to bring to the forefront key theories, concepts and methodological approaches to the study of the movement of people. \n   In seven parts, the Handbook dissects important areas of cross-disciplinary and generational discourse for graduate students, early career researcher, migration management practitioners, and academics in the fields of media and migration studies, international development, communication studies, and the wider social science discipline. \n   <strong>  Part One: Keywords and Legacies</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Two: Methodologies</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Three: Communities</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Four: Representations</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Five: Borders and Rights</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Six: Spatialities</strong>   \n   <strong>  Part Seven: Conflicts</strong>     ","reviews":"   Due to the range of its themes, approaches, voices and contexts, this volume will be an indispensable guide to all scholars working on migration and media, and will furthermore open up a new space for methodological and conceptual reflection on a world in which movement and mediation are two sides of the same coin.    -- Arjun Appadurai      Scholarship on media and migration research has exploded in recent years. This outstanding volume captures the breadth and urgency of this important and rapidly-evolving work. A must-read for anyone working on media, migration and displacement.  \n    -- Mirca Madianou   This volume of over 50 chapters traverses enormous terrain in interrogating the entanglements of migration and media, highlighting the politics of encounter and the powerful combinations and permutations that shape contemporary migrant lives across the globe. What is truly excellent is the timely focus on social media, data science and digital technologies, and the impact on knowledge hierarchies and social justice in migration research. \n.    -- Brenda Yeoh      Highlighting questions of power inequalities, processes, and dynamics within the intersections of media and migration, this book is a path-breaking vital and welcome contribution to   migration and media studies. This Handbook provides insights into a central question of both these fields, that of representation and mediation. With careful attention paid to definitions, methodologies, and emerging issues, this book will be invaluable to scholars and students alike. \n    -- Nina Glick Schiller","subject":"Media studies,

Online behavior is at once a psychological, social, and technological phenomena, and qualitative approaches require both rigor and context, which Robert V. Kozinets offers in abundance.

This third edition of his essential guide to netnographic research practices provides a very welcome update to the framework, taking in even more of the complex and ever-changing landscape of current social media platforms and their uses, and offering a wealth of ideas for working with qualitative social media data.

Netnographic practices detail ways of understanding and engaging with communities considering the necessary ethics of digital qualitative research.

Thoughtful review questions and activities help students to maintain the learning process, and there is a good focus on the practical problems of criminological research. There is also a welcome emphasis on the global dimensions of criminology: in particular International trafficking networks and the interface between state crime and problems of international human rights enforcement. -- John Lea","subject":"Crime & criminology, Crime & criminology, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Criminology, Social Sciences: Textbooks & Study Guides, Crime, Crime & criminology","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191029","page_count":null,"usd_price":"122.00","gbp_price":"85.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Making Sense of Data in the Media","isbn":"9781526447197","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526447193","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526447193","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526447193","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526447193","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526447193","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526447193","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526447193","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526447193","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526447193","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526447193","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526447197","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526447197","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526447197","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526447197&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526447197&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526447197","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526447197","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526447197&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526447197&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526447197","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526447197","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526447197","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526447197","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526447197","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526447197","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526447197;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781526447197.jpg","author":"Andrew Bell, Todd Hartman, Aneta Piekut, Alasdair Rae, and Mark Taylor","blurb":"Through a series of examples of statistics in the media, this book shows you how to critically assess the presentation of data in the media, to identify what is significant and to sort verifiable conclusions from misleading claims.

This book will help you ask those all-important questions and demystify statistics. From 'is that a lot?' to 'is that possible?' the authors guide you through statistical techniques that are easy to understand and simple to apply. Read it, learn the techniques and use them to become a critical data consumer. -- Jackie Carter   There are two ways to learn about statistics. You could endure pages of maths, formulae and words that are, literally, 'so last century' (or more). Or you could learn from informative case studies exploring how, when and why data are used well or badly in today's society. I prefer the second option; happily, the authors do too. -- Richard Harris   This excellent new book goes beyond the familiar fundamental concepts of statistics to cover the vital, but often neglected issues of place and time.

Written by one of the best Criminological Ethnographers in the business, this text reinvigorates the debate over the role of ethnography in the study of crime and criminal justice and will serve as an invaluable and insightful resource for both novice and seasoned ethnographers of criminological issues. -- Anthony Ellis, Lecturer in Sociology and Criminology, University of Salford      If the fundamental goal of criminology is to explain why crime occurs - rather than measure where, when and how often it occurs - we need to get out there into the real world and talk to the men, women and children who engage in it. Ethnography is the only research methodology that allows us to explore in detail human perceptions of criminal conduct, and without it our discipline would be much the poorer. In this wonderful book, Treadwell - one of criminology's most celebrated ethnographers - offers a spirited defence of and a detailed guide to the art of ethnographic fieldwork... a must-read for undergraduate students in the social sciences, postgraduate students about to head out into the field and academics keen investigate the real world. \n    -- Professor Simon Winlow, Head of Criminology, Northumbria University","subject":"Crime & criminology, Social & cultural anthropology, ethnography, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Criminology, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Methodology, Social Issues, Services & Welfare, Crime, Crime & criminology, Social & cultural anthropology","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191029","page_count":null,"usd_price":"122.00","gbp_price":"85.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Research Methods for Public Health","isbn":"9781526430007","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1526430002","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1526430002","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1526430002","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1526430002","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1526430002","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1526430002","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1526430002","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1526430002","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1526430002","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1526430002","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781526430007","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781526430007","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781526430007","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781526430007&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781526430007&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781526430007","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781526430007","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781526430007&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781526430007&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781526430007","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781526430007","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781526430007","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781526430007","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781526430007","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781526430007","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781526430007;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781526430007.jpg","author":"Stuart McClean, Isabelle Bray, Nick de Viggiani, Emma Bird, and Paul Pilkington","blurb":"   Offers an in-depth introduction to the theories, concepts, approaches and practices, relevant to research methods in a public health setting.

Adopting a strategic perspective, the chapters emphasize the importance of aligning the performance management system with the organization's goals and integrating it with all other components of the HR system.  The combination of evidence-based principles and skill development activities reinforce key concepts and promote meaningful learning.  \n    -- Randall S. Schuler and Susan E. Jackson      Cutting through the myriad of fads and myths, <em>  Performance Management Systems: An Experiential Approach </em>  provides a science-based approach to achieve the strategic promise of performance management systems.

They offer a sharp, multi-dimensional and probing commentary on how organizational change comes about, why it so often goes against the intentions of its instigators, why it breeds resistance and why resistance is not necessarily a bad thing.  \n \nThey are not afraid to engage and offer compelling commentaries on what exactly counts as change, why one person sees change where another sees continuity, who stands to benefit and lose from change. Above all, they demonstrate the practical wisdom of approaching change as a fluid phenomenon that can at best be managed but not fully controlled. This is a must for all scholars of organizational change and practitioners wise enough to look beyond the recipe book.\"  -- Professor Yiannis Gabriel","subject":"Organizational theory & behaviour, Organizational theory & behaviour, BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Organizational Behavior, BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Management, Business, Accounting & Vocational: Textbooks & Study Guides, Business and Management, Organizational theory & behaviour","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":null,"pub_date_iso":"20191214","page_count":null,"usd_price":"172.00","gbp_price":"120.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Supervision and Professional Development in Social Work Practice","isbn":"9789353286514","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/9353286514","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9353286514","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/9353286514","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/9353286514","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/9353286514","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/9353286514","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/9353286514","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/9353286514","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/9353286514","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/9353286514","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9789353286514","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9789353286514","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9789353286514","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9789353286514&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9789353286514&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9789353286514","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9789353286514","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9789353286514&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9789353286514&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9789353286514","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9789353286514","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9789353286514","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9789353286514","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9789353286514","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9789353286514","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9789353286514;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9789353286514.jpg","author":"Amanda M Nickson, Margaret- Anne Carter, and Abraham P.
