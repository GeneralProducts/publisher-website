The trend toward decentralization of analysis has made this fascinating field one of the fastest-growing branches of analytical chemistry. As electroanalytical devices have moved from conventional electrochemical cells (10-20 mL) to current cells (e.g. 5-50 mL) based on different materials such as paper or polymers that integrate thick- or thin-film electrodes, interesting strategies have emerged, such as the combination of microfluidic cells and biosensing or nanostructuration of electrodes.\n\n This book provides detailed, easy procedures for dynamic electroanalysis and covers the main trends in electrochemical cells and electrodes, including microfluidic electrodes, electrochemical detection in microchip electrophoresis, nanostructuration of electrodes, development of bio (enzymatic, immuno, and DNA) assays, paper-based electrodes, interdigitated array electrodes, multiplexed analysis, and combination with optics. Different strategies and techniques (amperometric, voltammetric, and impedimetric) are presented in a didactic, practice-based way, and a bibliography provides readers with additional sources of information.","reviews":"","subject":"Analytical chemistry, SCIENCE / Chemistry / Analytic, Chemistry, Science, Analytical chemistry","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Oct 12, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20191012","page_count":null,"usd_price":"125.00","gbp_price":"95.95","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Palladacycles","isbn":"9780128155059","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0128155051","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0128155051","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0128155051","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0128155051","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/0128155051","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/0128155051","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/0128155051","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/0128155051","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/0128155051","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0128155051","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9780128155059","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9780128155059","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780128155059","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9780128155059&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9780128155059&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9780128155059","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780128155059","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9780128155059&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9780128155059&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9780128155059","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9780128155059","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9780128155059","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780128155059","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9780128155059","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9780128155059","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9780128155059;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Catalysis and Beyond","image_path":"9780128155059.jpg","author":"Anant Kapdi and Debabrata Maiti","blurb":"Palladacycles: Catalysis and Beyond provides an overview of recent research in palladacycles in catalysis for cross-coupling and similar reactions. In the quest for developing highly efficient and robust palladium-based catalysts for C-C bond formation via cross-coupling reactions, palladacycles have played a significant role. In recent years, they have found a wide variety of applications, ranging from catalysts for cross-coupling and related reactions, to their more recent application as anticancer agents. This book explores early examples of the use of palladacyclic complexes in catalysis employing azobenzene and hydrazobenzene as coordinating ligands. Its applications in processes such as selective reduction of alkenes, alkynes, or nitroalkanes are also covered.\n\n Palladacycles: Catalysis and Beyond reveals the tremendous advances that have taken place in the potential applications of palladacycles as versatile catalysts in academia and industry.

First, it is written as an introduction to and survey of nanomaterials with a careful balance between basics and advanced topics. Thus, it is suitable for both beginners and experts, including graduate and upper-level undergraduate students. Second, it strives to balance the colloidal aspects of nanomaterials with physical principles. Third, the book highlights nanomaterial based architectures including composite or hybrid conjugates rather than only isolated nanoparticles. A number of ligands have been utilized to biodecorate the polymer and composite nanocarriers. Finally, the book provides an in depth discussion of important examples of reaction mechanisms of bottom-up building of functionalized nanoparticles, or potential applications of nanoarchitectures, ranging from physical to chemical and biological systems.","reviews":"","subject":"Solid state chemistry, SCIENCE / Chemistry / Physical & Theoretical, Chemistry, Science, Solid state chemistry","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Jul 19, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190719","page_count":null,"usd_price":"230.00","gbp_price":"180.00","format":"Hardback"},{"title":"Bioinspired Design of Materials Surfaces","isbn":"9780128148433","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0128148438","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0128148438","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0128148438","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0128148438","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/0128148438","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/0128148438","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/0128148438","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/0128148438","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/0128148438","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0128148438","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9780128148433","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9780128148433","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780128148433","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9780128148433&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9780128148433&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9780128148433","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780128148433","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9780128148433&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9780128148433&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9780128148433","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9780128148433","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9780128148433","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780128148433","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9780128148433","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9780128148433","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9780128148433;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9780128148433.jpg","author":"Yongmei Zheng","blurb":"Bioinspired Design of Materials Surfaces reviews novel methods and technologies used to design surfaces and materials for smart material and device applications.
